                        any time. Failure to provide the requested additional documents will
                        prevent the User from registering on the Artwide Platform and participating
                        in any sale or purchase of any Property, or may result in suspension.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.6. Failure to provide or update the information (where
                        applicable) in clauses 3.2. to 3.5. inclusive will prevent the User from

                        for the purchase of Property to the satisfaction of Artwide, failing which
                        Artwide may refuse disclosure to you of its bank account information and/or
                        (in the event payment has already been made to Artwide) to process onward
                        payment to a Seller.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        affiliated company, their respective servants, directors, officers and

                    <p>
                        5.7. Artwide reserves the right at its sole discretion to
                        reject the listing of any Property for any reason whatsoever, including but

                        during shipment of the Property, until title in the Property transfers to
                        the Buyer in accordance with clause 9.1.

                        <strong>6. BUYER’S CONDITIONS</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.1. The Buyer will be bound by the purchase once the Sales
                        Invoice is issued.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.2. The Buyer should carry out its own inspections and
                        investigations into any Property and satisfy itself or consult with its own

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.3. All Property is sold by the Sellers on “as is” basis,
                        meaning that you purchase the Property with full knowledge of physical
                        condition of the Lot at the time of the sale, without reliance on any
                        representation, warranty, or assumption of liability of any kind as to
                        physical condition of the Lot made by us or the Seller. A physical
                        condition report from us or the Seller may be available on your request,
                        but you should conduct your own inspection. Photographs on the Artwide
                        Platform of any Property are for identification purposes only and will not
                        convey the actual condition of the Property.
                    </p>

                        6.4. The Buyer may arrange a viewing, at his own and entire
                        cost, of the Property prior to purchase. The Buyer has two options for
                        viewing:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.4.1. The Property may be viewed by the Buyer in the city where
                        the Property is located at a location designated by Artwide. Charges may
                        apply; or
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.4.2. The Property may be viewed by the Buyer in a location
                        agreed between the Buyer, the Seller and Artwide. Charges may apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In any event, the Property will be at all times held to the Seller’s order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.5. It is the Buyer’s sole responsibility to identify and
                        obtain any necessary import, export, endangered species or any other permit
                        for the Property. Artwide makes no representations or warranties as to
                        whether any Property is or is not subject to export or import restrictions.
                        The denial of any permit or licence shall not justify the cancellation of
                        the sale and purchase agreement or any delay in payment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.6. Following the purchase of any Property, payment is due
                        immediately (and in any event within 2 Business Days) upon receipt of
                        Artwide’s invoice issued in accordance with clause 8.2. below and should be
                        made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to Artwide’s bank
                        account or held in escrow by Artwide’s escrow agent (as determined from
                        time to time). For the avoidance of doubt, all invoices shall be sent via
                        e-mail by Artwide and shall be deemed to have been received at the time such
                        e-mail is sent by Artwide. If you are paying in cryptocurrency, please refer
                        to the Appendix 1 Clause 3.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.7. Artwide will only provide its bank account information
                        to the Buyer once it has received from the Buyer all documentation and
                        information as required under clause 3 of these Private Sales Terms and
                        Conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.8. Artwide does not accept cash or credit card payments at
                        all.

                    <p>
                        6.9. Artwide reserves the right to decline payments received
                        from a third party who is not the Buyer of the Property and reserves the
                        right to seek identification and documentary evidence of the source of any
                        funds received.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.10. The Buyer will pay Artwide for deficiency, any and all
                        costs, handling charges, late charges and expenses (including, without
                        limitation, taxes and duties) incurred by Artwide in relation to shipment,
                        packing and storage of any Property. The Buyer might pay for the costs and
                        expenses for any Property that is shipped to the Buyer for viewing and/or
                        any purchased Property shipped by Artwide to the Buyer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.11. The Buyer is solely responsible for all taxes and duties
                        of any kind, including but not limited to VAT, that may be payable on any
                        Property.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.12. Without prejudice to any rights Artwide or the Seller may
                        have, in the event the Buyer fails to pay the Purchase Price in accordance
                        with the procedure set out in clause 8 below, the Buyer will be in default
                        and liable for the Purchase Price and all fees, charges and expenses,
                        including but not limited to shipment, storage and insurance costs, and
                        taxes and duties, as set out in these Private Sales Terms and Conditions.
                        Artwide in its sole discretion (having informed the Seller) may exercise
                        one or more of the following remedies:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.12.1. resell the Property;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.12.2. we may charge interest on the unpaid amount due from the Due
                        Date at the rate of 15% per annum from time to time;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.12.3. we may cancel the sale of the Property. If we do this, we may
                        sell the Property again, either publicly or privately on such terms we
                        shall think necessary or appropriate, in which case you must pay us any
                        shortfall between the Purchase Price and the proceeds from the resale. You
                        must also pay all costs, expenses, losses, damages and legal fees which we
                        have incurred or may suffer and any shortfall in the Seller’s commission on
                        the resale;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.12.4. we may pay the Seller an amount up to the net proceeds
                        payable in respect of the amount you agreed to in which case you shall
                        acknowledge and understand that we will have all of the rights of the
                        Seller to demand you for such amounts due;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.12.5. we may hold you legally responsible for the Purchase Price
                        and may begin legal proceedings to recover this sum together with other
                        losses, interest, legal fees and costs as far as we are allowed by law to
                        recover from you;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.12.6. we may deduct the amounts what you owe us from any amounts
                        which we or any Artwide Group Company may owe you (including any deposit or
                        other part-payment which you have paid to us);
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.12.7. we may, at our option, reveal your identity and inform your details to the Seller;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.12.8. we may reject at any future Private Sales offers made by you
                        or obtain a deposit from you;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.12.9. we may exercise all the rights and remedies of a person
                        holding security over any property in our possession owned by you, whether
                        by way of pledge, security interest or in any other way as permitted by the
                        law of the place where such property is located. You will be deemed to have
                        granted such security to us and we may retain such property as collateral
                        security for fulfilment your obligations to us;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.12.10. if you owe money to us or to any Artwide Group Company, we may
                        use or deal with any of your property we hold or which is held by another
                        Artwide Group Company in any way permissible by law. We will only release
                        your property to you after you pay us or the relevant Artwide Group Company
                        in full for what you owe. However, if we choose, we may sell your property
                        in any way we think appropriate. We are entitled to use the proceeds of the

                        representative as set out in clause 8.9. above, the Purchase Price will be
                        returned to the bank account from which the Buyer transferred the funds

                        misrepresentation made by it, or in respect of death or personal injury
                        caused by negligence.

                    <p>
                        12.2. The information referred to in clause 12.1. above shall

                        12.3. This clause 12 shall continue to apply after the
                        suspension or termination of a User’s account or the revocation of these
                        Private Sales Terms and Conditions, but shall not apply to information
                        which comes into the public domain (unless it has come into the public
                        domain through unauthorised disclosure by the Users).

                    <p>
                        12.4. Artwide may disclose information to third parties (e.g.
                        shippers) for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under these
                        Private Sales Terms and Conditions.

                    <p>
                        12.5. Some countries do not offer equivalent legal protection of
                        personal information to that offered within the EU. It is Artwide&apos;s policy
                        to require that any such third parties respect the privacy and
                        confidentiality of our Users&apos; information and provide the same level of
                        protection for clients&apos; information as provided within the EU, whether or
                        not they are located in a country that offers equivalent legal protection of
                        personal information. By consenting to these Private Sales Terms and
                        Conditions, you agree to such disclosure.

                        not be disclosed by us to any Buyer or any other person. The identity of a
                        Buyer will be kept confidential and will not be disclosed by us to any
                        Seller or any other person provided that, if the Buyer fails to pay the
                        Purchase Price in accordance with these Private Sales Terms and
                        Conditions, we may, at our option, reveal the Buyer’s identity to the
                        Seller.

                        regard to the Property other than as envisaged by these Private Sales Terms
                        and Conditions, and shall not take any steps, directly or indirectly, which
                        are designed to circumvent, or which do circumvent, these Private Sales
                        Terms and Conditions.

                    <p>
                        13.2. In the event a User sells any Property to a User outside
                        the Artwide Platform in breach of these Private Sales Terms and Conditions,
                        Artwide&apos;s Commission as set out in clause 7 will be due and payable in full
                        to Artwide by the Seller.

                        liability, whether in whole or in part, to or from another User or Artwide
                        or any of its directors, employees, officers or representatives with a view
                        towards gaining any advantage in connection with the sale or purchase of
                        Property through the Artwide Platform or otherwise.

                    <p>
                        15.1. In using and transacting on the Artwide Platform, each
                        User shall not engage in any activity, practice or conduct which would
                        constitute a tax evasion offence in relation to taxes and/or duties payable
                        (if any) arising out of the sale or purchase of any Property.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        16.1. Without limiting other remedies available to Artwide,
                        Artwide reserves the right to limit, suspend or terminate your User

                        your Property listed on the Artwide Platform or other content posted by you
                        if Artwide considers at its sole discretion that you are in breach of any
                        of the terms of these Private Sales Terms and Conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        16.2. Artwide may terminate, change, suspend, add to or

                    <p>
                        16.3. These Private Sales Terms and Conditions represent the
                        entire understanding between Artwide and you with regard to its subject
                        matters and supersedes any and all other and prior agreements between
                        Artwide and you in relation to such matters.

                    <p>
                        16.4. You may not assign, transfer, charge or deal with these
                        Private Sales Terms and Conditions or all or any part of the benefit of, or
                        the rights and benefits under these Private Sales Terms and Conditions,
                        except with the prior written consent of Artwide.

                        Conditions is so found to be invalid or unenforceable but would be
                        valid or enforceable if some part of the provision were deleted, the
                        provision in question shall apply with such modification(s) as may be
                        necessary to make it valid and enforceable in the relevant jurisdiction
                        but shall continue to apply without any modification in all other
                        relevant jurisdictions.

                        Agreement under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance (Cap. 623
                        of the Laws of Hong Kong).

                        payment of the Purchase Price and any additional costs, either in
                        cryptocurrency, fiat Currency, or a combination of both, and have confirmed
                        the acceptance to the Buyer in writing.

                    <p>
                        1.1. Except in the event you are a resident of Mainland China, you,
                        the Buyer, may make payment of the Purchase Price and any additional costs
                        Tether (USDT) (or other cryptocurrencies accepted by us, at the cost and
                        expense of the Buyer) via a digital wallet transfer to us if we have
                        stipulated that payment may be made in cryptocurrency for a Lot, provided
                        always that the Purchase Price and any other sums which together constitute
                        the full amount of the Purchase Price shall be payable only in US Dollar or
                        Euro or other fiat currencies of the sale accepted by us.

                    <p>
                        1.2. We reserve the right to specify that we will only accept a

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.2. We reserve the right to amend this list at our sole discretion
                        and specify which further or alternative digital wallet providers your

                        by the providers specified by us will be credited towards the purchase of a
                        Property. We will not recognise payments from digital wallets hosted by
                        other providers, or from self-hosted digital wallets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.4. If you do not have such a digital wallet maintained by a
                        provider specified by us, we may refuse to permit your participation in the
                        sale. Further, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to cancel the
                        contract for sale between you and the Seller.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.5. You must be the owner of the digital wallet, or, if you
                        registered a bid as a company, then the company must be the owner.

                            confirming that the cryptocurrency payment was made from a digital wallet
                            owned by you and maintained by one of the providers listed above.

                            For the avoidance of doubt, “ownership” of a digital wallet
                            means either you hold or have held on your behalf, or the company on whose

                        2.6. Partial payments of a single Property from multiple digital
                        wallets will not be allowed. If you purchase multiple lots, you may
                        purchase one Property with payment from one digital wallet and another
                        Property with payment from a different digital wallet, but this must be
                        accomplished through two separate transactions paying the Purchase Price
                        and any additional costs in full.

                    <p>
                        Payment of the Purchase Price or any additional costs, if made in
                        cryptocurrency, must be made in full upon receipt of the invoice for the
                        respective Property, and no later than the specified time indicated on the
                        invoice. Alternatively, payment of the Purchase Price or any additional
                        costs, which together constitute the full amount of the Purchase Price
                        shall be made to us in accordance with clause 8.2.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        4.1. Where we determine that payment for the Purchase Price and any
                        additional costs are to be made in cryptocurrency, our invoice to you will
                        specify (i) the Purchase Price in the fiat currency of the sale (i.e., US
                        dollar, Hong Kong dollar…), and (ii) any additional costs in Tether or
                        other accepted cryptocurrencies, including any associated exchange fees
                        (cryptocurrency to fiat) charged by our gateway partners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.2. The respective cryptocurrency amount(s) will be calculated by
                        us based on the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For Tether (if accepted): the USD/USDT hourly quoted CoinDesk
                            Tether Price Index at the start time of the auction. The USD/USDT rate will
                            then be converted into HKD/USDT using the HKD/USD exchange rate provided by
                            our bank on the same day as the USDT/USD is quoted.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For Ether (if accepted): the USD/ETH hourly quoted CoinDesk
                            Ether Price Index (ETX) at the start time of the auction. The USD/ETH rate
                            will then be converted into HKD/ETH using the HKD/USD exchange rate
                            provided by our bank on the same day as the ETH/USD is quoted; or
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For Bitcoin (if accepted): the USD/BTC hourly quoted CoinDesk
                            Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) at the start time of the auction. The USD/BTC
                            rate will then be converted into HKD/BTC using the HKD/USD exchange rate
                            provided by our bank on the same day as the BTC/USD is quoted,
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        or equivalent rates applicable to other cryptocurrency where we specify
                        acceptance of this additional or alternative cryptocurrency, as determined
                        by us at the time the invoice is issued and will be disclosed in the
                        invoice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our certificate as to such rate(s) will be conclusive and final.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.3. You understand that the price of cryptocurrencies can be
                        volatile and subject to upward and downward movements. You undertake to pay
                        the specified fiat currency amount or cryptocurrency amount set out in the
                        invoice, regardless of whether the fiat currency to cryptocurrency or other
                        conversion rate differs at the time of your payment to the rate used to
                        calculate the cryptocurrency amount set out in the invoice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.4. You understand that if you fail to make full payment upon
                        receipt of our invoice and by the specified time indicated on the invoice,
                        in accordance with these Conditions, we will only accept payment for the
                        Purchase Price and any additional costs in the specified fiat currency of
                        the sale, as per Clause 8.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.5. Partial payment in cryptocurrency, alongside fiat currency or
                        another cryptocurrency, is discouraged and should be discussed with us
                        prior to the issuance of any invoice.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        5.1. We are committed to the fight against money laundering and

                        from you at our sole discretion in order for us to comply with our

                        successful bid, we may cancel the contract for sale between you and the
                        seller.
