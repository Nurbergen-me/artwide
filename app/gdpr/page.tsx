                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal Data shall be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner.</li>
                        <li>Personal Data collected will only be those specifically required for the purposes set out in
                            Section 2 above. Such data will only be processed for those purposes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Personal Data shall only be retained for as long as it is required to fulfil contractual
                            requirements, or to develop statistics for Artwide’s benefit.
                        </li>
                        <li>Personal Data shall be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to
                            the purposes for which they are collected and/or processed. Personal Data shall be accurate
                            and, where necessary, kept up to date.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Data Subject has the right to request from Artwide access to and rectification or
                            erasure of his/her Personal Data, to object to or request restriction of processing

                            be put in writing as in Section 3 above.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Data Subject has the right to make a complaint directly to a supervisory authority within
                        his/her own country. Artwide’s Data Protection compliance:</p>
                    <p>Artwide International H.K. Limited<br/>
                        Address: Room 1104, Crawford House, 70 Queen’s Road Central, Central, Hong Kong<br/>
                        Email Address: <a href="mailto:info@artwide.com">info@artwide.com</a></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal Data shall only be processed based on the legal basis explained in Section 2 above,
                            except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the
                            Data Subject which will always take precedent. If the Data Subject has provided specific
                            additional consent to the processing, then such consent may be withdrawn at any time (but
                            may then result in an inability to fulfil travel requirements).
                        </li>
                        <li>Artwide will not use Personal Data for any monitoring or profiling activity or process, and
                            will not adopt any automated decision-making processes.

                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>6. TRANSFERS TO THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
                    <p>For the purposes set out in Section 2 above, Artwide will in most cases deem it necessary to
                        process Personal Data via a third party (these will include but are not limited to credit
                        agencies, website or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, email service
                        providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and other similar
                        service providers). Personal Data shall only be transferred to, or processed by, third party
                        companies where such companies are necessary for the fulfilment of the abovementioned work.</p>
                    <p>In order to provide our services, Artwide may need to transfer Data Subject’s information from
                        their respective countries of residence to another country in the usual course of its business.
                        By dealing with Artwide and submitting such personal information, the Data Subject agrees to the
                        transfer, storage, and/or processing of their personal information outside of their countries of
                        residence as set out below.</p>
                    <p><strong>Transferring outside of the EEA</strong></p>
                    <p>Artwide may transfer personal information of Data Subjects to third party data processors located
                        in countries outside of the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”). Such transfer will
                        not be made without consent of the Data Subject.</p>
                    <p>Artwide only transfers personal information of Data Subjects to those third parties where Artwide
                        can be sure that Artwide can protect the privacy and rights of Data Subjects, for example the
                        third party is located in a country which the EU has deemed to have adequate data protection
                        laws in place, where that third party is certified on the EU-US Privacy Shield or where Artwide
                        has a contract in place with that third party which includes the European Commission&apos;s standard
                        data protection clauses. Additionally, Personal Data shall not be transferred to a country or
                        territory outside the EEA unless the transfer is made to satisfy the Legitimate Interest of
                        Artwide in regard to its contractual arrangements with its clients.</p>

                        <li>Vital interests: the processing is necessary to protect someone’s life.</li>
                        <li>Public task: the processing is necessary to perform a task in the public interest, and the

                        </li>
                        <li>Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the Data
                            Controller unless there is a good reason to protect a Data Subject’s Personal Data which

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>(Article 6 of the GDPR)</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The right to be informed; this means anyone processing Personal Data must make clear to a
                            Data Subject what they are processing, why, and who else the Personal Data may be passed to.
                        </li>
                        <li>The right of access; this is a Data Subject’s right to see what data is held about him/her
                            by a Data Controller.
                        </li>
                        <li>The right to rectification; the right to have a Data Subject’s Personal Data corrected or

                        <li>The right to erasure; under certain circumstances a Data Subject can ask for his/her
                            Personal Data to be deleted. This is also called “the Right to be Forgotten”. This would
                            apply if the Personal Data is no longer required for the purposes it was collected for, or
                            his/her consent for the processing of the Personal Data has been withdrawn, or the Personal
                            Data has been unlawfully processed.
                        </li>
                        <li>The right to restrict processing; this gives a Data Subject the right to ask for a temporary
                            halt to processing of Personal Data, such as in the case where a dispute or legal case has
                            to be concluded, or the Personal Data is being corrected.
                        </li>
                        <li>The right to data portability; a Data Subject has the right to ask for any Personal Data
                            supplied directly to the Data Controller by him/her, to be provided in a structured,
                            commonly used, and machine-readable format.
                        </li>
                        <li>The right to object; a Data Subject has the right to object to further processing of his/her
                            Personal Data which is inconsistent with the primary purpose for which it was collected,
                            including profiling, automation, and direct marketing.
                        </li>
                        <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling; a Data Subject has the right
                            not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
