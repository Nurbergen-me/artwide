                    <p>4.3. You agree to indemnify and hold us and each Buyer harmless from and against any and all
                        claims, actions, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) relating

                        Agreement.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. ESTIMATES</strong></p>
                    <p>5.1. Estimates are based on the physical condition, rarity, quality and provenance of a Lot and
                        prices recently paid at any auctions for similar property.</p>
                    <p>5.2. Estimates are shown on the Property Schedule. Any Estimate listed on the Property Schedule
                        is provisional and is subject to revision by us from time to time in our sole discretion.</p>
                    <p>5.3. Estimates are not a guarantee of the Purchase Price at which we will sell a Lot and is a
                        statement of opinion only. We make no representation or warranty of the anticipated selling
                        price of any Property, and neither you, nor anyone else, may rely on any Estimate as a
                        prediction or guarantee of the actual selling price or value of a Lot for any purposes. We will
                        not be liable for any errors or omissions with respect to any descriptions of the Property made
                        in relation to the Online Auction in the Artwide Platform and make no guarantees,
                        representations or warranties whatsoever to you with respect to the Property, including its
                        Authenticity, attribution, legal title, condition, value or otherwise.</p>
                    <p>5.4. For the avoidance of doubt, Estimates do not include any applicable taxes, charges, or
                        artist’s resale royalty (if applicable).</p>
                    <p><strong>6. RESERVES</strong></p>
                    <p>6.1. Unless a different Reserve has been agreed upon by you and us and confirmed in writing
                        before a sale of a Lot in the Artwide Platform, the Reserve for each Lot of the Property will be
                        the following:</p>
                    <p>(a) the Reserve specifically stated on the Property Schedule; or</p>
                    <p>(b) if no Reserve is stated on the Property Schedule, 60% of our latest announced or published
                        pre-sale Low Estimate.</p>
                    <p>6.2. Notwithstanding the above, we may sell any Lot of the Property at a price below the Reserve,
                        provided that we pay you in accordance with these Terms the Net Sale Proceeds which you would
                        have been entitled to receive had such Lot of the Property been sold at the Reserve. No Reserve
                        for a Lot will exceed the pre-sale Low Estimate of the Lot.</p>
                    <p>6.3. You agree to us that once a Buyer has accepted to purchase a Lot at a price equal to or
                        higher than the Reserve, you are not permitted to withdraw the Lot and is legally bound to sell
                        the Lot to the Buyer in the Artwide Platform, subject to the terms set out in this
                        Agreement.</p>

                    <p>7.1. You will not be charged with any commission for each Lot sold to a Buyer via an Online
                        Auction in the Artwide Platform.</p>

                        do so on your behalf. However, we will have the right as your agent to bid on your behalf, but
                        only up to the amount of the Reserve.</p>
                    <p><strong>10. LIMITS OF LIABILITY</strong></p>

                        agent’s control);</p>
                    <p>(d) in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise for any business losses, such as loss

                    <p><strong>11. WITHDRAWAL</strong></p>
                    <p>11.1. You shall not withdraw any Property from sale in the Artwide Platform after the date on
                        which you sign the Consignment Agreement and be bound by this Agreement unless we have breached
                        this Agreement in a way that:</p>
                    <p>(a) it cannot be remedied or rectified; or</p>
                    <p>(b) it has not been remedied or rectified before sale in the Artwide Platform or within 14
                        Business Days from the date on which you have informed us in writing of our breach (whichever is
                        earlier),</p>
                    <p>and you have informed us in writing as soon as reasonably possible after you have become aware of
                        our breach of material obligations under this Agreement.</p>
                    <p>11.2. Regardless of whether we have previously published any descriptions of the Property, such
                        as the Sale Particulars, or advertised its sale in the Artwide Platform, we reserve the right to
                        withdraw any Property from a sale in the Artwide Platform in our complete discretion at any time
                        (whether prior to or during a sale of the Property in the Artwide Platform) and shall have no
                        liability whatsoever with regard to such withdrawal. For the avoidance of doubt, if any Property
                        is withdrawn for any reason, the timing and the content of any announcement for the withdrawal
                        shall be in our sole discretion.</p>
                    <p>11.3. We may withdraw a Lot from the sale in the Artwide Platform if:</p>
                    <p>(a) there is doubt as to its Authenticity or attribution or its sale would or may subject us or

                    <p>(b) there is doubt as to the accuracy of any of your representations or warranties, including,
                        but not limited to, those set out in clause 4 of these Terms;</p>
                    <p>(c) you have breached any provision of this Agreement, regardless of materiality of such
                        breach;</p>
                    <p>(d) a Lot of the Property incurs loss or damage so that it is not in the state in which it was
                        when we agreed for its sale in the Artwide Platform; or</p>
                    <p>(e) we determine in our reasonable discretion that its sale may be detrimental to our reputation
                        or brand.</p>
                    <p>11.4. The arrangements for the Withdrawal Fee which you may be liable to us for a withdrawal of

                    <p><strong>2. SELLER</strong></p>
                    <p>2.1. We may sell a Lot as the Seller or the Seller’s agent. If a Lot is owned by us, we will be
                        the Seller. If a Lot is owned by a third party, that third party will be the Seller, whose
                        identity will not be disclosed to you.</p>
                    <p>2.2. Where a third party is a Seller, we will be selling the Lot owned by the Seller as the
                        Seller’s agent, meaning that we are concluding the contract of sale of the Lot on the Seller’s
                        behalf. In other words, the contract of sale of the Lot created by your successful bid is
                        contractually binding between you and the Seller only, and not between you and us. However, we
                        will still give certain contractual undertakings to you, which are further described below in
                        these Conditions.</p>
                    <p>2.3. The identity of a Seller will be kept confidential and will not be disclosed by us to any
                        Buyer or any other person. Subject to clause 12(f), the identity of a Buyer will be kept
                        confidential and will not be disclosed by us to any Seller or any other person.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. BEFORE THE SALE</strong></p>
                    <p>3.1. Description of Lots</p>
                    <p>(a) Certain words used in the Sale Particulars to describe a Lot have special meanings.</p>
                    <p>(b) All of our description and report on physical condition of a Lot and other statements
                        (whether made orally or in writing) relating to any Lot, such as their nature, condition,
                        artist, period, materials, approximate dimensions or provenance, are solely based on our opinion
                        and not to be relied on as a statement of fact. We do not carry out any in-depth research, which
                        is carried out by professional historians and scholars.</p>
                    <p>3.2. Our responsibility for our description of Lots</p>
                    <p>We do not provide any guarantee in relation to the nature of any Lot save for the Authenticity
                        Warranty set out in clause 8.2.</p>
                    <p>3.3. Physical condition of Lots</p>
                    <p>The physical condition of a Lot can vary widely due to multiple factors, such as age, previous
                        damage, restoration, repair and wear and tear. This means that a Lot will rarely be in perfect
                        physical condition. Lots are sold by Sellers to you on &quot;as is&quot; basis, as stated in clause 9.3
                        below.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>3.4. Estimates</p>
                    <p>Estimates are based on the physical condition, rarity, quality and provenance of a Lot and prices
                        recently paid at auctions for similar property. Estimates may change. Neither you, nor anyone
                        else, may rely on any Estimate as a prediction or guarantee of the actual selling price or value
                        of a Lot for any purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Estimates do not include any Buyer’s
                        Premium, applicable taxes or charges, or artist’s resale royalty (if applicable).</p>
                    <p><strong>4. REGISTERING TO BID</strong></p>
                    <p>4.1. Registration as a bidder in the Artwide Platform</p>
                    <p>(a) New bidders: If you have not previously bid and do not have an account on our Artwide
                        Platform, you will need to create an account on the Artwide Platformby following our

                    <p>(b) Returning bidders: If you are a returning bidder who has not bought anything from us in the
                        last two years or if you want to spend more than on previous occasions, we may ask you for
                        updated information. If you have any questions, please contact our Client Services (<a
                            href="http://support@artwide.com">support@artwide.com</a>).</p>
                    <p>(c) When you join the Artwide Platform as a User, you accept all terms and conditions set out in
                        these Conditions, together with Artwide’s Terms and Private Sales Terms and Conditions, Privacy
                        Policy, GDPR Privacy Notice and any other terms and conditions as may be published on the
                        Artwide Platform or notified to you from time to time.</p>
                    <p>(d) You will need to give us sufficient time to process and approve your registration. We may, at
                        our sole discretion, decline to permit you to register as a bidder.</p>
                    <p>(e) For the avoidance of doubt, we will ship a Lot only to the designated address which you have
                        provided in accordance with 1(a) below.</p>
                    <p>4.2. Individual or corporate registration</p>
                    <p>(a) When registering to bid as an individual, you accept that in making a bid, you are accepting
                        personal liability to pay the Purchase Price. In order to register to bid, you are required to
                        supply the information requested by us, including but not limited to those requested under 3
                        below.</p>
                    <p>(b) If you are bidding on behalf of a company, you are accepting personal liability to pay the
                        Purchase Price unless it has been explicitly agreed in writing with us before the commencement
                        of the sale that you are bidding in an Online Auction as an agent of the company acceptable to
                        us and provide documents required for our due diligence purposes listed under clause 3(b) below,
                        in which case the company for whom you are acting as an agent will only be personally liable to
                        pay the Purchase Price. As an authorized agent of the company, you must select the appropriate
                        registered account of the company at time of sale. If the company does not already have a
                        registered account with us, you will first need to create one as an authorized person. Please
                        contact our Client Services (<a href="mailto:support@artwide.com">support@artwide.com</a>) to
                        set up a transaction account for the company.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. ABSENTEE BIDDING</strong></p>
                    <p>5.1. Submitting Absentee Bids</p>
                    <p>(a) Prospective buyers who are unable or choose not to participate in the bidding process during
                        the auction may submit absentee bids.</p>
                    <p>(b) Absentee bids can be submitted through Artwide’s official website or by contacting Artwide’s
                        client services team.</p>
                    <p>(c) Absentee bids must specify a maximum bid amount, which represents the highest price the
                        bidder is willing to pay for a lot.</p>
                    <p>(d) All absentee bids must be received no later than 24 hours before the scheduled closing time
                        of the auction, unless otherwise stated by Artwide.</p>
                    <p>5.2. Execution of Absentee Bids</p>
                    <p>(a) For online-only auctions, absentee bids will be executed automatically by Artwide’s system or
                        administrative team, up to the maximum bid specified by the absentee bidder. The system will
                        place bids on behalf of the absentee bidder at the lowest increment necessary to maintain their
                        position as the highest bidder, subject to bidding increments and any reserve price.</p>
                    <p>(b) In the event that Artwide conducts live, in-person auctions, absentee bids may be executed by
                        the auctioneer on behalf of the absentee bidder, following the same principles.</p>
                    <p>(c) In the case of identical absentee bids, priority will be given to the bid that was received
                        first.</p>
                    <p>(d) Whilst Artwide will make reasonable efforts to execute absentee bids, it accepts no liability
                        for any errors, omissions, or technical failures that may occur in the submission or execution
                        of such bids.</p>
                    <p>5.3. Notification of Successful Absentee Bids</p>
                    <p>(a) Successful absentee bidders will be notified within 24 hours of the conclusion of the auction
                        via the contact information provided at the time of bid submission.</p>
                    <p>(b) Upon notification, successful absentee bidders are required to fulfil payment and collection
                        obligations as outlined in these Terms and Conditions.</p>
                    <p><strong>6. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING DOCUMENTATION</strong></p>
                    <p>6.1. As these Conditions are subject to Hong Kong law, we will request you to provide certain
                        documents and information to satisfy our client identification and verification and other due
                        diligence requirements under anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorist
                        regulations before you can become a registered bidder and participate in an Online Auction.</p>
                    <p>6.2. Failure to provide the required documents</p>
                    <p>If in our opinion you do not satisfy our bidder identification and registration procedures to our
                        satisfaction, including, but not limited to, completing any anti-money laundering or
                        anti-terrorism financing checks, we may refuse to register you to bid or permit your
                        participation in the sale of a Lot in an Online Auction. Even if you make a successful bid, we
                        may cancel the contract for sale between you and the Seller.</p>
                    <p>6.3. Documents or deposits required from a registered bidder</p>
                    <p>(a) If you are registered as an individual bidder, you shall provide us with certified copies of
                        the following documents:</p>

                        bank statement issued within previous 3 months).</p>
                    <p>(b) If you are registered as a corporate bidder, you shall provide us with certified copies of
                        the following documents:</p>
                    <p>(i) documentary evidence of registration as a company (i.e. Certificate of Incorporation,
                        Certificate of Formation or Certificate of Good Standing);</p>
                    <p>(ii) documentary evidence of beneficial ownership (i.e. register of shareholders, articles of
                        organization or association, or any other constitutional documents of a company);</p>
                    <p>(iii) documentary evidence of registered address (i.e. utility bill, storage contract or bank
                        statement, if the registered address is not listed on company documents);</p>
                    <p>(iv) valid government-issued identification documents of an authorized person of a corporate
                        client who is participating in an Online Auction as a registered bidder (i.e. national identity

                    <p>(vi) authorization letter or board resolution duly signed by a director of a corporate client
                        authorizing the registered bidder to bid at an Online Auction on its behalf and, where

                    <p>(vii) documentary proof of directors and beneficial owners of a corporate client (i.e. register

                    <p>(c) For trusts, partnerships, offshore companies and other business structures, please contact
                        our Client Services (<a href="mailto:support@artwide.com">support@artwide.com</a>) in advance to
                        discuss our requirements.</p>
                    <p>(d) Where any payment is required to be made to us for the purchase of a Lot in an Online
                        Auction, you shall provide information and documentary evidence to establish the source of the
                        funds sought to be paid to us for the purchase of a Lot to our satisfaction, failing which we
                        may refuse to disclose our bank account information and/or (in the event payment has already
                        been made to us) to process onward payment to the Seller.</p>
                    <p>(e) We may also ask you to give us a financial reference and/or a deposit as a condition of
                        allowing you to bid. We may also require deposits of a portion of a placed bid, which we will
                        use to offset the appropriate portion of the Purchase Price only if you become a successful
                        bidder and otherwise will be promptly returned to you if you do not become a successful bidder.
                        For further information or help, please contact our Client Services (<a
                            href="mailto:support@artwide.com">support@artwide.com</a>).</p>
                    <p>(f) In the event that we require a physical copy of the document required under this clause, you
                        shall be liable to pay any courier or delivery charges which may incur.</p>
                    <p><strong>7. AUCTION</strong></p>
                    <p>7.1. Reserves</p>
                    <p>(a) Unless otherwise indicated, the sale of each Lot is subject to a Reserve, meaning that a Lot
                        shall not be sold at an Online Auction for a price which is lower than the Reserve of the
                        Lot.</p>
                    <p>(b) We reserve the right to lower the Reserve of any Lot during an Online Auction.</p>
                    <p>7.2. Bidding increments</p>
                    <p>(a) Bids may only be submitted between the dates and times specified in the Sale Particulars of a
                        Lot.</p>
                    <p>(b) As soon as you place and confirm your bid amount, the bid is submitted and you accept and
                        agree that submitted bid is final and that you may not, under any circumstances, amend, retract
                        or revoke your bid. We are not responsible for any errors you make in bidding. Once you have
                        made a bid, the next bidding increment is shown for your convenience on your &quot;Place Bid&quot;
                        button.</p>
                    <p>(c) Bidding generally opens at or up to 25% below the Low Estimate as determined at our sole
                        discretion. Bidding increases in bidding increments as follows (or in such other increment as
                        may be determined by Artwide from time to time):</p>

                    <p id="buyerspremium">8.1. Buyer’s Premium</p>
                    <p>(a) We will charge you the Buyer’s Premium on the Hammer Price of each Lot sold. The Buyer’s
                        Premium is charged on the Hammer Price at the following rates:</p>
                    <p>(i) 14.5% on the Hammer Price up to USD1,500,000.00; plus</p>(ii) 9.5% on any part of the Hammer
                    Price equal to or over USD1,500,000.01.<p></p>
                    <p>(b) A total sum of the Buyer’s Premium charged by us will be cumulative sum of the Buyer’s
                        Premium charged on the Hammer Price determined in accordance with clause 1(a) above.</p>
                    <p>8.2. Taxes</p>
                    <p>(a) You, as a successful bidder, are responsible for ascertaining and paying all applicable taxes
                        levied including, but not limited to, any sales or compensating use tax or equivalent tax
                        wherever such taxes may arise on the Hammer Price, Buyer’s Premium, or any other charges
                        relating to a Lot.</p>
                    <p>(b) Tax liability and tax rates depend on the particular circumstances of the Buyer so this
                        section should be used only as a general guide, and we recommend you obtain your own independent
                        tax advice.</p>
                    <p>(c) As for any purchased Lot which we ship, sales or use tax may be levied on the Hammer Price
                        and Buyer’s Premium, and any other charges relating to a Lot may be levied, depending on the
                        matters such as the origin of the Lot, or the residency or tax residency of the Buyer. The
                        applicable sales tax rate may also be determined based upon the state, county, or locale to
                        which the Lot will be shipped. We will collect sales tax for a Lot, if legally required.</p>
                    <p>(d) If you claim any exemption from sales tax levied in any jurisdictions, you must provide
                        appropriate documentation to us, prior to the release of the Lot by us or within 90 days after
                        the sale, whichever is earlier.</p>
                    <p>8.3. Artist’s Resale Royalty</p>
                    <p>In certain countries, local laws entitle the artist or the artist’s estate with artist’s resale
                        right under which either of them can claim a royalty from you or a Seller when a Lot created by
                        the artist is sold to you. If a Lot is subject to an artist’s resale right, you must pay us an
                        extra amount equal to the royalty, unless the applicable law requires the payment to be made by
                        a Seller. If artist’s resale royalty is applicable, we may calculate the same using the exchange
                        rate applicable on the day of the sale. We will forward the royalty received from you to the
                        appropriate government authority on your or a Seller’s behalf.</p>
                    <p>8.4. Shipping charges</p>
                    <p>(a) Unless otherwise stated, any shipping charges you will be required to pay include
                        international shipping charges for delivery of a Lot to your designated delivery address. The
                        shipping charges will not include (i) any applicable local taxes and handling fees; and (ii) any
                        customs duty, import tax and any local clearance fees applicable to your country.</p>
                    <p>(b) Where the Buyer elects the Lot to be shipped by our nominated shipper and agrees with the
                        quote provided by them, the Buyer will be responsible and separately charged for all shipping
                        charges.</p>
                    <p>(c) It is your responsibility to ascertain and pay any applicable international duties, custom
                        charges, taxes, charges and tariffs owed to the appropriate government entity, and any other
                        charges that need to be paid prior to shipment or delivery of the purchased Lot, including, but
                        not limited to, any third-party charges necessary to facilitate shipment as well as any
                        necessary insurance charges. For the avoidance of doubt, Artwide is not responsible for any
                        payment in connection with the clearance of customs or the shipment of the Lot or taking out any
                        insurance for a shipment.</p>

                    <p>9.1. Seller’s warranties</p>
                    <p>(a) The Seller of a Lot gives you the following warranties that the Seller:</p>

                        the other co-owners, or a person who is authorized by the legal owner of the Lot or under law to

                    <p>(c) The Seller shall not be responsible to you for any reasons for loss of profits or business,
                        expected savings, loss of opportunity or interest, costs, expenses or any special,
                        consequential, incidental or indirect damages of any kind or any damages which fall within the
                        meaning of ‘special’, ‘incidental’ or ‘consequential’ under applicable local law.</p>
                    <p>(d) The Seller of a Lot gives no warranty in relation to the Lot other than as set out above in
                        this clause and the Authenticity Warranty (if applicable) and, as far as permitted by law, any
                        other warranties or obligations of the Seller which may be added to these Conditions by
                        applicable law are excluded.</p>
                    <p>9.2. Our Authenticity Warranty</p>
                    <p>(a) We warrant that that each Lot listed for the Online Auctions are Authentic, subject to the
                        following limitations below:</p>
                    <p>(i) The Authenticity Warranty do not apply if you have failed to give us a written notice of your

                    <p>(ii) The Authenticity Warranty is given only for information shown in the title description of
                        the Sale Particulars of a Lot;</p>
                    <p>(iii) The Authenticity Warranty does not apply where the title description of the Sale
                        Particulars of a Lot either matched the generally accepted opinion of experts or drew attention
                        to any conflict of opinion at the time of sale;</p>
                    <p>(iv) The Authenticity Warranty does not apply if a Lot can only be shown not to be Authentic by a
                        scientific process which (i) was not available or generally accepted for use; (ii) was
                        unreasonably expensive or impractical; or (iii) was likely to have damaged a Lot, on the date we
                        published the Sale Particulars; and</p>
                    <p>(v) The benefit of the Authenticity Warranty is only available to the original Buyer shown on the
                        invoice for a Lot issued at the time of the sale and only if on the date of the notice of claim,
                        the original Buyer is the full legal owner of the Lot and the Lot is free from any claim,
                        interest or restriction by anyone else. The benefit of this Authenticity Warranty may not be
                        transferred to anyone else.</p>
                    <p>(b) In order for you to claim under the Authenticity Warranty from us and to be entitled to the

                    <p>(ii) if requested by us, obtain written opinions of two recognized experts in the field of the
                        Lot mutually agreed by you and us confirming that the Lot is not Authentic (and if we have any
                        doubts, we reserve the right to obtain additional opinions at our expense without your consent);
                        and</p>
                    <p>(iii) return the Lot at your expense to the place from where it was shipped to you in the

                    <p>(c) For the avoidance of doubt, your only right under this Authenticity Warranty is to cancel the
                        sale and receive a refund of the Purchase Price paid by you to us. We will not, in any
                        circumstances, be required to pay you more than the Purchase Price nor will we be liable for any
                        reason for loss of profits or business, expected savings, loss of opportunity or interest,
                        costs, expenses or any special, consequential, incidental or indirect damages of any kind or any
                        damages which fall within the meaning of ‘special’, ‘incidental’ or ‘consequential’ under
                        applicable local law.</p>
                    <p>9.3. Disclaimer of additional warranties by us and the Seller</p>
                    <p>(a) To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, we and the Seller disclaim and

                        anyone else.</p>

                        below, and we shall not be liable to you for any reason for any special, consequential,

                    <p>You warrant that the funds used for payment of the Purchase Price are not connected with any
                        criminal activity, including tax evasion, and that you and the company which you are acting for
                        as an authorized person (if applicable) are neither under investigation, nor you and such

                    <p>10.1. You will be bound by the purchase of a Lot once you have become a successful bidder in the

                        yourself or consult with your own experts prior to purchase of the Lot.</p>
                    <p>10.3. All Lots are sold by the Sellers on &quot;as is&quot; basis, meaning that you purchase a Lot with
                        full knowledge of physical condition of the Lot at the time of the sale, without reliance on any

                        Lot made by us or the Seller. A physical condition report from us or the Seller may be available
                        on your request, but you should conduct your own inspection.</p>
                    <p>10.4. It is your sole responsibility to identify and obtain any necessary import, export,
                        endangered species, or any other permit for a Lot. We make no representations or warranties as
                        to whether a Lot is or is not subject to any export or import restrictions. The denial of any
                        permit or licence shall not justify the cancellation of the purchase of a Lot or any delay in
                        payment.</p>
                    <p>10.5. Following the purchase of a Lot, payment is due by the Due Date in accordance with clause 1
                        below and should be made by any of the payment modes stipulated in clause 10.2 below. For the
                        avoidance of doubt, all invoices will be sent via e-mail by us and shall be deemed to have been
                        received by you at the time such e-mail is sent by us.</p>
                    <p>10.6. We do not accept cash, credit card or cheque payments for purchasing Lots.</p>
                    <p>10.7. We reserve the right to decline payments received from a third party who is not our
                        registered bidder in an Online Auction and reserve the right to seek identification and
                        documentary evidence of the source of any funds received.</p>
                    <p>10.8. We may cancel the sale of a Lot if (i) any of your warranties in clause 4 is not correct;
                        (ii) we reasonably believe that completing the sale is or may be unlawful; or (iii) we
                        reasonably believe that the sale may damage our or the Seller’s reputation and/or place us or
                        the Seller under any liability to anyone else.</p>
                    <p>10.9. You will pay us for any deficiency, any and all costs, handling charges, late charges, and
                        expenses (including, without limitation, taxes and duties) incurred by us in relation to
                        shipment, packing and storage of a Lot in accordance with clause 12</p>
                    <p>10.10. We own the copyright in all images, illustrations and written material produced by or for
                        us relating to a Lot, including the contents of our Sale Particulars. You cannot use them
                        without our prior written permission. We do not offer any guarantee that you will gain any
                        copyright or other reproduction rights to a Lot which you have purchased.</p>
                    <p>10.11. You are solely responsible for all taxes and duties of any kind that may be payable on
                        your purchased Lot and you will pay any taxes and duties of any kind due to us in accordance
                        with clause 2 above.</p>
                    <p>10.12. Without prejudice to any rights we or the Seller may have, in the event that you fail to
                        pay the Purchase Price of a Lot in accordance with the procedures set out in clause 10 below,
                        you will be in default and liable for the Purchase Price and all fees, charges and expenses,
                        including but not limited to shipment, storage and insurance costs, and taxes and duties, as set
                        out in these Conditions. In our sole discretion, we may inform the Seller and exercise one or
                        more of the follow remedies (as well as any other rights or remedies we have by law):</p>
                    <p>(a) we may charge interest on the unpaid amount due from the Due Date at the rate of 15% per
                        annum from time to time;</p>
                    <p>(b) we may cancel the sale of the Lot. If we do this, we may sell the Lot again, either publicly
                        or privately on such terms we shall think necessary or appropriate, in which case you must pay
                        us any shortfall between the Purchase Price and the proceeds from the resale. You must also pay
                        all costs, expenses, losses, damages and legal fees which we have incurred or may suffer and any
                        shortfall in the Seller’s commission on the resale;</p>
                    <p>(c) we may pay the Seller an amount up to the net proceeds payable in respect of the amount bid
                        by your default in which case you shall acknowledge and understand that we will have all of the
                        rights of the Seller to demand you for such amounts due;</p>
                    <p>(d) we may hold you legally responsible for the Purchase Price and may begin legal proceedings to
                        recover this sum together with other losses, interest, legal fees and costs as far as we are
                        allowed by law to recover from you;</p>
                    <p>(e) we may deduct the amounts what you owe us from any amounts which we or any Artwide Group
                        Company may owe you (including any deposit or other part-payment which you have paid to us);</p>
                    <p>(f) we may, at our option, reveal your identity and inform your details to the Seller;</p>
                    <p>(g) we may reject at any future Online Auction any bids made by you or obtain a deposit from you
                        before accepting any bids;</p>
                    <p>(h) we may exercise all the rights and remedies of a person holding security over any property in
                        our possession owned by you, whether by way of pledge, security interest or in any other way as
                        permitted by the law of the place where such property is located. You will be deemed to have
                        granted such security to us and we may retain such property as collateral security for
                        fulfilment your obligations to us;</p>
                    <p>(i) if you owe money to us or to any Artwide Group Company, we may use or deal with any of your
                        property we hold or which is held by another Artwide Group Company in any way permissible by
                        law. We will only release your property to you after you pay us or the relevant Artwide Group
                        Company in full for what you owe. However, if we choose, we may sell your property in any way we
                        think appropriate. We are entitled to use the proceeds of the sale of the property to set off
                        any amounts you owe us, and we will pay any remaining proceeds of that sale to you. If there is
                        a shortfall, you must pay us any difference between the proceeds of the sale of the property and
                        the amount you owe us; and</p>
                    <p>(j) we may take any other action we see necessary or appropriate.</p>
                    <p>In any event, you will be liable for any deficiency, any and all cost, handling charges, late
                        charges, expenses, legal fees, collection fees and incidental damages incurred by us.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>10.13. You are prohibited from offering a Lot for re-sale until ownership has been passed to you
                        in accordance with clause 1 below. You will comply with any restrictions on re-sale of a Lot
                        imposed by the Seller. Failure to comply with these conditions will lead to immediate
                        termination of your registered account and you will be subject to all remedies available to
                        us.</p>
                    <p><strong>11. PAYMENT</strong></p>
                    <p>11.1. Purchase Price and payment</p>
                    <p>(a) Immediately following the sale of a Lot during an Online Auction, you must pay the Purchase

                    <p>(v) any applicable duties, goods, sales use, compensating or service tax.</p>
                    <p>(b) You will be issued an invoice by us as the Seller or as agent for the Seller (as the case may
                        be) for the Purchase Price as soon as practicable following receipt of the invoice from the
                        Seller (if applicable).</p>
                    <p>(c) The invoice issued by us to you is due and payable immediately. In any event, payment of the
                        Purchase Price should be made by wire transfer no later than the Due Date being the

                    <p>(d) We will only accept payment from the registered bidder and our invoice will contain
                        information of the registered bidder. Once issued, we cannot change the Buyer’s name on an
                        invoice or re-issue the invoice in a different name. You must pay the Purchase Price by the Due
                        Date even if you want to export the Lot and you need an export licence to do so.</p>

                    <p>12.1. Transfer of ownership to you</p>
                    <p>The ownership of a Lot will not pass to you until (i) we have confirmed that you have met all
                        bidder identification and registration procedures; and (ii) we have received full, clear and
                        undisputed payment of all amounts due to us including the Purchase Price, even in circumstances

                    <p><strong>13. SHIPMENT</strong></p>
                    <p>13.1. Transport and shipping</p>
                    <p>(a) If you choose to have us arrange the shipping of your Lot via one of our partners, then
                        unless otherwise explicitly agreed by us or unless the Lot purchased by you requires a special
                        permit (in which case shipment may be delayed), we will endeavor to ship your Lot to the
                        designated delivery address which you provided at registration no later than 30 days from
                        receipt of full and clear payment for the Purchase Price for the Lot.</p>
                    <p>(b) You must ensure that you provide a valid delivery address at registration for a Lot to be
                        shipped. Except in very limited circumstances, we will only ship to the registered address on
                        your account which you provided at the time of Purchases cannot be delivered to P.O. boxes. Our
                        shipping partners will only operate a curbside or ground floor delivery, unless otherwise agreed
                        with you. You are responsible for paying any shipping charges if the Lot is returned to the
                        Seller or us due to your failure to provide a valid delivery address, or to pay any duty, import
                        taxes or customs processing fees, or failure of a recipient to sign and accept delivery, where
                        necessary. You will be responsible for any and all shipping expenses, including costs, packing
                        and handling, as specified in the Sale Particulars. We shall use reasonable efforts to take care
                        when handling, packing and facilitating any shipment of a Lot, but we are not responsible for
                        any acts or omissions of any third party retained or hired for these purposes, including,
                        without limitation, any packing, shipping or delivery of a Lot. Similarly, where we suggest any
                        third-party handler, packer or carrier upon request, we do not accept liability for their acts,
                        omissions or neglect and you agree to release us from any such liability.</p>
                    <p>(c) Subject to clause 1(e) below, we will obtain any special permits required for the export or
                        import of the product and will be regarded as the &quot;Exporter of Record&quot;. As the recipient of the
                        package, you will be regarded as the &quot;Importer of Record&quot; and you must appoint a shipper as your
                        agent to manage all import and customs clearance procedures and to ensure that customs duties
                        and taxes are paid to the relevant customs and tax authorities in your country.</p>
                    <p>(d) Our shipping partners may contact you directly if necessary for delivering your Lot or making
                        arrangements for pick-up, if you need to return a Lot.</p>
                    <p>(e) Shipping is currently not possible to countries subject to international embargoes. If the
                        country you wish to ship to is unavailable or if you have questions generally about
                        international shipping, please contact our Client Services (<a
                            href="mailto:support@artwide.com">support@artwide.com</a>).</p>
                    <p>(f) You expressly agree not to divert, reship or forward any part of a shipment to any country
                        subject to international embargoes.</p>
                    <p>(g) If you have any questions about international shipping in general, or about a specific
                        shipment of our products, please contact our Client Services (<a
                            href="mailto:support@artwide.com">support@artwide.com).</a></p>
                    <p>13.2. Customs Duty and Tax</p>
                    <p>(a) Customs duty and import tax are specific to a particular country. Customs authorities in each
                        country calculate duty and tax based on a number of factors, including:</p>
                    <p>(i) the category in which a Lot is classified in the international Harmonised System Code
                        (HSC);</p>
                    <p>(ii) the value of a Lot, meaning the amount of the successful bid; and</p>
                    <p>(iii) for most countries, duty is calculated on a &quot;CIF&quot; basis (meaning Cost, Insurance and
                        Freight), so the shipping charge you pay will also be factored into the calculation of the duty
                        you will pay.</p>
                    <p>(b) It is your responsibility to ascertain and pay any applicable international duties, custom
                        charges, taxes, charges and tariffs owed to the appropriate government entity or that otherwise
                        need to be paid prior to shipment or delivery including any third-party charges necessary to
                        facilitate shipment. Artwide shall not be responsible for any damages, losses, costs or delays
                        in this respect.</p>
                    <p>13.3. Delivery times</p>
                    <p>Where required, your purchases will be shipped via international air. Delivery time depends on a
                        number of variables, and there may be delays such as bad weather affecting air transport, or a
                        package being held for inspection by customs. Neither we nor our shipping partners are liable
                        for any delays in international transportation or customs clearance. Shipments can be delivered
                        directly to most addresses, however in certain remote areas you may need to pick up your package
                        from the closest service point of our nominated shipping partner.</p>
                    <p>13.4. Loss or damage during shipment</p>
                    <p>(a) Be sure to check the details of your purchase carefully on receipt and check the contents of
                        the package promptly upon If you have a problem with a Lot, contact our Client Services (<a
                            href="mailto:support@artwide.com">support@artwide.com</a>).</p>
                    <p>(b) On rare occasions, a package may be lost or the contents be damaged during international
                        shipment no matter how carefully it is handled. If your package is lost or damaged in
                        international transit, you will need to submit a claim within 14 days of the date of delivery,
                        or within 14 days of the date you received confirmation that it was lost. To make a claim,
                        contact our Client Services (<a href="mailto:support@artwide.com">support@artwide.com</a>).</p>
                    <p>(c) For the avoidance of doubt, if you have not taken out any insurance for shipment of the Lot,
                        you shall be solely liable for all damages, if any, incurred in the course of and arising out of
                        the shipment.</p>
                    <p>13.5. Limitation to export and import</p>
                    <p>(a) Certain Lot sold may be affected by laws on exports from the country in which it is sold and
                        the import restrictions of other countries. Many countries require a declaration of export for
                        property leaving the country or an import declaration on entry of property into the country.
                        Obtaining the necessary permits or licenses may result in additional costs and subsequent
                        delays. Local laws may prevent you from importing a Lot or selling a Lot in the country you
                        import it into. Unless otherwise agreed by us in writing, the fact that you may need to apply
                        for an import or export license or some other permit or license for shipment may result in
                        additional time to process at an additional cost and does not affect your obligation to make
                        payment on the payment Due Date nor our right to charge interest or storage charges on late
                        payment. A delay in obtaining required permits or licenses shall not justify a rescission of any
                        sale nor a delay in making full payment for a Lot, and we shall not be obliged to refund any
                        interest or other expenses incurred by you. Local laws may prohibit the import or export of some
                        property or the resale of some property in the country of importation. It is your responsibility
                        to check if a Lot can be imported into or transported to the specified delivery location and
                        plan for additional time to apply for and receive the appropriate and necessary permits or
                        licenses. No such restriction or delays associated with processing shipments shall justify the
                        rescission of any sale or delay in making full payment for a Lot.</p>
                    <p>(b) You alone are responsible for getting advice about and meeting the requirements of any laws
                        or regulations which apply to exporting or importing any Lot prior to bidding. If you are
                        refused a license or there is a delay in getting one, you must still pay us in full for the Lot.
                        We may be able to help you apply for the appropriate licenses if you ask us to and pay our fee
                        for doing so, however we cannot guarantee that you will obtain all necessary licenses. For more
                        information, contact our Client Services (<a

                    <p>14.2. We:</p>
                    <p>(a) shall not be responsible to you for any reason (whether for breaching these Conditions or any
                        other matter relating to your purchase of, or bid for, any Lot) except for fraud or fraudulent

                        business losses, such as loss of data, profits, revenue, business, opportunity, goodwill,
                        reputation or business interruption or for any losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by us
                        arising directly or indirectly from your use or inability to use our Artwide Platform, any
                        delays or disruptions to our Artwide Platform, viruses or other malicious software obtained by

                    <p>14.3. If, in spite of the terms in clauses 2(a) to 13.2(d) above, we are found to be liable to
                        you for any reason, the aggregate amount of our liability shall be limited to the Purchase Price
                        actually received by us. We will not be responsible to you for any reason for loss of profits or
                        business, loss of opportunity or value, expected savings or interest, costs, damages, or
                        expenses; and</p>
                    <p>14.4. Neither we nor the Seller will be responsible for any failure to meet any obligation which
                        we or the Seller has under these Conditions or under the Sale Particulars which is caused by
                        circumstances beyond our or the Seller’s reasonable control. This includes, but is not limited
                        to strikes, lockouts, fire, flood, natural disasters, war, armed conflict, terrorist attack and
                        nuclear and chemical contamination.</p>
                    <p><strong>15. PERSONAL INFORMATION, PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION</strong></p>
                    <p>15.1. We will hold and process your personal information and may pass it to any Artwide Group
                        Company for use as described in and in line with our privacy notice as may be published from
                        time to time on the Artwide Platform and in accordance with the Personal Data (Privacy)
                        Ordinance (Cap 486 of Laws of Hong Kong).</p>
                    <p>15.2. In order to ship a Lot internationally to you, we may provide certain personal information
                        about you to our nominated shippers, including your name, delivery address and phone number,
                        details and the Purchase Price of your purchased Lot, and the weight and dimensions of the
                        package. Our shippers will treat this information as private and confidential and will only use
                        it for the purpose of providing international shipping and any customs clearance services you
                        request from them in order to deliver your Lot to you. Information about the packages being
                        shipped to you will be provided to the necessary authorities for purposes of export, import,
                        duty, tax, and security screening. The information may include your name, delivery address,
                        description of the goods, their value, the number of pieces, and the weight of the package. This
                        information is required by law and regulations applicable in the countries from where and to
                        where packages are transported. Our shipping partners are committed to responsible data
                        management, comply with applicable data protection legislation, and employ industry standard
                        practices to protect the security of your data, which may be stored and processed in the United
                        Kingdom, the United States, and other countries.</p>
                    <p><strong>16. GENERAL TERMS</strong></p>
                    <p>16.1. No failure or delay to exercise any right or remedy provided under these Conditions shall
                        constitute a waiver of any right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict the further
                        exercise of any right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall
                        prevent or restrict the further exercise of any right or remedy.</p>

                    <p>16.4. Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to these
                        Conditions, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or
                        termination thereof or any dispute regarding non- contractual obligations arising out of or
                        relating to it shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Hong

                        Arbitration Rules in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted. The law of this

                    <p>16.5. If it is found that any part of these Conditions is not valid, or is illegal or impossible
                        to enforce, that part of the Conditions will be treated as being deleted, and the rest of the
                        Conditions shall not be affected and remain in full force and effect and be binding upon

                    <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICES</strong></p>
                    <p>Our Sale Particulars of a Lot entries are not intended to describe the physical condition of the
                        Lot and you are advised to seek professional advice before purchasing a Lot.</p>
                    <p>The following expressions with their accompanying explanations are used by us as standard
                        cataloguing practice. Our use of these expressions does not take account of the physical
                        condition of a Lot of the extent of any of its restoration.</p>
                    <p><strong>Property owned in part or in full by Artwide </strong></p>
                    <p>From time to time, we may offer a Lot which we own in whole or in part.</p>
                    <p><strong>Minimum Price Guarantee</strong></p>
                    <p>On certain occasion, we have a direct financial interest in the outcome of the sale of a Lot
                        consigned for sale. This will usually be where we have guaranteed to a Seller that whatever the
                        outcome of the sale, the Seller will receive a minimum sale price for the Lot, as known as a
                        minimum price guarantee.</p>
                    <p><strong>Third Party Guarantees/Irrevocable bids </strong></p>
                    <p>Where we have provided a minimum price guarantee, we are at risk of making a loss, which can be
                        significant, if the Lot fails to sell. We therefore sometimes choose to share that risk with a
                        third party who agrees prior to an Online Auction to place an irrevocable written bid on the
                        Lot. If there are no other higher bids, that third party commits to buy the Lot at the level of
                        their irrevocable written bid.&nbsp; In doing so, the third party takes on all or part of the
                        risk of the Lot not being sold. If the Lot is not sold, the third party may incur a loss.</p>
                    <p>We compensate the third party in exchange for accepting this risk provided that the third party
                        is not the successful bidder. The remuneration to the third party may either be based on a fixed
                        fee or an amount calculated against the Hammer Price. The third party may also bid for the Lot
                        above the irrevocable written bid. Where the third party is the successful bidder, the third
                        party is required to pay the Hammer Price and the Buyer’s Premium in full.</p>
                    <p>Third party guarantors are required by us to disclose to anyone they are advising their financial
                        interest in any Lot they are guaranteeing. However, for the avoidance of any doubt, if you are
                        advised by or bidding through an agent on a Lot identified as being subject to a third-party
                        guarantee, you should always ask your agent to confirm whether or not he or she has a financial
                        interest in relation to the Lot.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bidding by parties with an interest</strong></p>
                    <p>A party with a direct or indirect interest in a Lot, such as a person who may have knowledge of
                        the Reserve or any other material information relating to a Lot, may be bidding on the Lot. The
                        example of such persons are the beneficiaries of an estate that consigned a Lot or a joint owner
                        of a Lot. Any interested party that successfully bids on a Lot must comply with these
                        Conditions, including paying us with the Buyer’s Premium and any applicable taxes of a Lot.</p>
                    <p><strong>Other arrangements</strong></p>
                    <p>We may enter into other arrangements not involving bids. These include arrangements where we have
                        given the Seller an advance on the proceeds of sale of a Lot or where we have shared the risk of
                        a guarantee with a partner who was not required to place an irrevocable written bid or otherwise
                        participating in the bidding on a Lot<strong><br/> </strong></p>
                    <p><strong>APPENDIX 1</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>TERMS FOR PAYMENT BY BUYERS IN CRYPTOCURRENCY </strong></p>
                    <p>This appendix shall apply when we have agreed to accept full or partial payment of the Hammer
                        Price, the Buyer’s Premium, and any additional costs, either in cryptocurrency, fiat Currency,
                        or a combination of both, and have confirmed the acceptance to the Buyer in writing.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>1. TYPE OF CRYPTOCURRENCY</strong></p>
                    <p>1.1. Except in the event you are a resident of Mainland China, you, the Buyer, may make payment

                        cryptocurrencies accepted by us, at the cost and expense of the Buyer) via a digital wallet
                        transfer to us if we have stipulated that payment may be made in cryptocurrency for a Lot,
                        provided always that the Hammer Price, the Buyer’s Premium, and any other sums which together
                        constitute the full amount of the Purchase Price under 1(a) shall be payable only in US Dollar
                        or Euro or other fiat currencies of the sale accepted by us.</p>
                    <p>1.2. We reserve the right to specify that we will only accept a particular cryptocurrency or
                        cryptocurrencies, in addition to, or in the alternative, to USDT, for an individual Lot or
                        Online Auction at our sole discretion.</p>
                    <p>1.3. If you offer to bid in a cryptocurrency not specified by us as acceptable to us for an
                        individual Lot or Online Auction, we may refuse to register you to bid or permit your
                        participation in the sale. Further, if you make a successful bid in such circumstances, we
                        reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to cancel the contract for sale between you and the
                        Seller.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. DIGITAL WALLET(S)</strong></p>
                    <p>2.1. You must send payment of the Hammer Price, the Buyer’s Premium, and any additional costs
                        directly to us from a digital wallet maintained with one of the following digital wallet
                        providers: Coinbase Custody Trust; Coinbase, Inc.; Coinbase Singapore Pte Ltd; Fidelity Digital

                    <p>2.2. We reserve the right to amend this list at our sole discretion and specify which further or
                        alternative digital wallet providers your digital wallet must be maintained by.</p>
                    <p>2.3. Only cryptocurrency payments sent from digital wallets hosted by the providers specified by
                        us will be credited towards the purchase of a Lot. We will not recognise payments from digital
                        wallets hosted by other providers, or from self-hosted digital wallets.</p>
                    <p>2.4. If you do not have such a digital wallet maintained by a provider specified by us, we may
                        refuse to register you to bid or permit your participation in the sale. Further, if you make a
                        successful bid, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to cancel the contract for sale
                        between you and the Seller.</p>
                    <p>2.5. You must be the owner of the digital wallet, or, if you registered a bid as a company, then
                        the company must be the owner.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You agree, upon our request, to provide documentation confirming that the cryptocurrency
                            payment was made from a digital wallet owned by you and maintained by one of the providers
                            listed above.
                        </li>
                        <li>For the avoidance of doubt, &quot;ownership&quot; of a digital wallet means either you hold or have
                            held on your behalf, or the company on whose behalf you are bidding holds, or has held on
                            its behalf, the private keys associated with that digital wallet or that the provider of the
                            digital wallet recognizes you, or the company on whose behalf you are bidding, as owning the
                            cryptocurrency associated with that digital wallet.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>2.6. Partial payments of a single Lot from multiple digital wallets will not be allowed. If you
                        purchase multiple lots, you may purchase one Lot with payment from one digital wallet and
                        another Lot with payment from a different digital wallet, but this must be accomplished through
                        two separate transactions paying the Hammer Price, the Buyer’s Premium, and any additional costs
                        in full.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. TIME FOR PAYMENT</strong></p>
                    <p>Payment of the Hammer Price, the Buyer’s Premium, or any additional costs, if made in
                        cryptocurrency, must be made in full upon receipt of the invoice for the respective Lot, and no
                        later than the specified time indicated on the invoice. Alternatively, payment of the Hammer
                        Price, the Buyer’s Premium, or any additional costs, which together constitute the full amount
                        of the Purchase Price shall be made to us in accordance with clause 10.1 and
                        10.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>4. CURRENCY CONVERSION</strong></p>
                    <p>4.1. Where we determine that payment for the Hammer Price, Buyer’s Premium, and any additional
                        costs are to be made in cryptocurrency, our invoice to you will specify (i) the Purchase Price
                        in the fiat currency of the sale (i.e., US dollar or Hong Kong dollar), and (ii) the Hammer
                        Price, the Buyer’s Premium, our cryptocurrency administrative costs and any additional costs in
                        Tether or other accepted cryptocurrencies, including any associated exchange fees
                        (cryptocurrency to fiat) charged by our gateway partners.</p>
                    <p>4.2. The respective cryptocurrency amount(s) will be calculated by us based on the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For Tether (if accepted): the USD/USDT hourly quoted CoinDesk Tether Price Index at the
                            start time of the auction. The USD/USDT rate will then be converted into HKD/USDT using the
                            HKD/USD exchange rate provided by our bank on the same day as the USDT/USD is quoted.
                        </li>
                        <li>For Ether (if accepted): the USD/ETH hourly quoted CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX) at the
                            start time of the auction. The USD/ETH rate will then be converted into HKD/ETH using the
                            HKD/USD exchange rate provided by our bank on the same day as the ETH/USD is quoted; or
                        </li>
                        <li>For Bitcoin (if accepted): the USD/BTC hourly quoted CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) at
                            the start time of the auction. The USD/BTC rate will then be converted into HKD/BTC using
                            the HKD/USD exchange rate provided by our bank on the same day as the BTC/USD is quoted,
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>or equivalent rates applicable to other cryptocurrency where we specify acceptance of this
                        additional or alternative cryptocurrency, as determined by us at the time the invoice is issued
                        and will be disclosed in the invoice.</p>
                    <p>Our certificate as to such rate(s) will be conclusive and final.</p>
                    <p>4.3. You understand that the price of cryptocurrencies can be volatile and subject to upward and
                        downward movements. You undertake to pay the specified fiat currency amount or cryptocurrency
                        amount set out in the invoice, regardless of whether the fiat currency to cryptocurrency or
                        other conversion rate differs at the time of your payment to the rate used to calculate the
                        cryptocurrency amount set out in the invoice.</p>
                    <p>4.4. You understand that if you fail to make full payment upon receipt of our invoice and by the
                        specified time indicated on the invoice, in accordance with these Conditions, we will only
                        accept payment for the Hammer Price, Buyer’s Premium, and any additional costs in the specified
                        fiat currency of the sale, as per Clause 10.</p>
                    <p>4.5. Partial payment in cryptocurrency, alongside fiat currency or another cryptocurrency, is
                        discouraged and should be discussed with us prior to the issuance of any invoice.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. SANCTIONS, ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (&quot;AML&quot;) AND COUNTER-TERRORIST FINANCING (&quot;CTF&quot;)
                        MEASURES</strong></p>
                    <p>5.1. We are committed to the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing and to
                        compliance with relevant sanctions laws. To this end, you undertake to comply with our
                        request(s) for Know-Your-Client (&quot;KYC&quot;), source of funds, and other information and
                        documentation fully, accurately, and promptly. We may require such information or documentation
                        from you at our sole discretion in order for us to comply with our Sanctions, AML and CTF
                        policies and our obligations under domestic and international law.</p>
                    <p>5.2. If, in our absolute discretion, you do not satisfy our bidder identification and
                        registration procedures, inclusive of, but not limited to (i) you being obstructive or
                        misleading in response to our requests for KYC, source of funds or other information and/or
                        documentation; (ii) you failing to provide KYC, source of funds or other documentation requested
                        by us at all or to the standard we require, to be determined at our sole discretion; and (iii)
                        passing any sanctions or AML and/or CTF checks to our satisfaction, we may refuse to register
                        you to bid, and if you make a successful bid, we may cancel the contract for sale between you
                        and the seller.</p>
                    <p>5.3. You warrant that if you make payment in cryptocurrency to us from a digital wallet, the
                        source of funds for the digital wallet is not attributable, either directly or indirectly,
                        to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a citizen or resident of, or located in, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Cuba or the Crimea region
                            of Russia or any other geographic area that is the target of comprehensive sanctions or
                            embargoes imposed by the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United Nations or the
                            United States;
                        </li>
                        <li>an individual, or an individual employed by or associated with an entity, identified on any
                            international embargo or sanction,
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>and you accept that we, in our absolute discretion, can make such enquiry as we require to
                        satisfy ourselves of the source of funds related to the transaction.</p>
