                        any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for Artwide.</p>

                        orders and subpoenas, or if it becomes necessary to protect the rights or property of
                        Artwide.</p>
                    <p><strong>4.4 Trade Sale or Merger</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>8. SECURITY</strong></p>
                    <p>We will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the security and integrity of all
                        personal data provided to the Artwide Platform, or by any other means electronic or
                        otherwise.</p>
                    <p>We will ensure that your personal data within Artwide is suitably protected against both
                        unauthorised physical and electronic access.</p>
                    <p>These measures include an electronic firewall and various other protection measures that involve
                        virus scanning, installation of security patches, vulnerability testing, backup and recovery
                        planning, employee training, security audits and other steps designed constantly to improve the
                        data protection posture.</p>
                    <p>However, we cannot guarantee that information during transmission through the internet or any
                        computer network is entirely safe from unauthorised intrusion, access or manipulation.</p>
                    <p>We will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors or unauthorised acts of
                        third parties. In any event, where we believe personal data has been compromised, we will notify
                        you of this and would endeavour to do so within 72 hours after we are or become aware of the
                        occurrence of such incident, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by
                        email. You consent to our use of email as a means of such notification.</p>
                    <p><strong>9. THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</strong></p>

                        information you provide to us will not be transmitted to other websites.</p>
                    <p>However, these websites may collect personal data about you in accordance with their own privacy
                        policies. Artwide is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such
                        websites.</p>
                    <p><strong>10. HOW LONG WILL ARTWIDE KEEP MY PERSONAL DATA?</strong></p>
                    <p>We will keep your personal data and records of any and/or all information associated with you
                        and/or your account for as long as your account is in use or is open, as long as is necessary to
                        comply with any tax, legal, and/or other regulatory requirements, and to protect and defend
                        against potential legal claims.</p>
                    <p>Further, please note that, in the event that you have given consent to such use or provision, you
                        may later request that Artwide ceases to use your personal data for direct marketing to which
                        you have previously consented. We will comply with such a request without charge.</p>

                    <p>Where appropriate, we may notify you directly of changes to the Privacy Policy either through
                        email or a prominent notice on the Artwide Platform.</p>
                    <p><strong>12. ENGLISH LANGUAGE PREVAILS</strong></p>
                    <p>If this Privacy Policy is published in a language other than English and there is any conflict
                        between such version and the English version, then the English version shall prevail.</p>

                    <p><strong>1. REGISTRATION</strong></p>
                    <p>During the registration process, we may ask you to provide sensitive information that allows us
                        to serve you better. We are keenly aware of the sensitivity of such information that you have
                        entrusted to us and have taken security measures to safeguard your personal data online.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may access your account information online from the Artwide Platform only with your
                            e-mail and password that is known to you only and that you have created on your online
                            account when you have been accepted as a user of the Artwide Platform.
                        </li>
                        <li>Artwide uses advanced technology to encrypt your login, password and information that is
                            stored in a secure database allowing limited access to a select few of authorized Artwide
                            employees only.
                        </li>
                        <li>Security professionals regularly conduct tests to determine our vulnerability and to fix
                            flaws immediately.

                        <li>Security patches are applied immediately as soon as they are released by the contractors

                    <p><strong>2. FRAUDULENT EMAILS</strong></p>
                    <p>Please note that Artwide never sends e-mails asking you to reply with your account or other
                        personal data. Should you wish to directly communicate with us, please contact us at <a
                            href="mailto:info@artwide.com">info@artwide.com</a> or via our website (<a
                            href="http://www.artwide.com">www.artwide.com</a>).</p>
                    <p>E-mail fraud is a common tool of identity thieves. An increasingly common fraudulent activity,
                        called &quot;phishing&quot;, uses official-looking e-mails to deceive consumers into disclosing their
                        personal data.</p>
                    <p>The e-mail often directs the recipient to a look-alike website of a legitimate business, tricking
                        consumers into believing they are responding to a valid request.</p>
                    <p>Other fraudulent e-mails entice users to make a purchase and are designed primarily to obtain
                        credit card or bank account information. Artwide never sends e-mails asking you to reply with
                        your account or other personal or financial information.</p>
                    <p>To avoid getting caught in any of these fraudulent activities, you are advised to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep your login details secret</li>
                        <li>Change your password periodically</li>
                        <li>Never give out your personal and account information by e-mail, telephone or whatever means,
                            unless you initiated the contact
                        </li>
                        <li>Verify that you are on the Artwide Platform (whether you are using the website version or
                            the mobile version), whenever you are about to register, edit or add information to your
                            account, or set up a new user account. You may want to add a URL to Artwide&apos;s website to
                            your browser&apos;s Favourites or Bookmarks menu
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>3. CONTACT</strong></p>
